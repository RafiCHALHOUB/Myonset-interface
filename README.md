# Myonset M1 Project README

## Introduction:
The Myonset M1 project is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application designed for detecting and analyzing Electromyography (EMG) signals. This project implements a view-model architecture to provide an intuitive interface for users to interact with EMG data effectively.

## Features:
1. **EMG Signal Detection:** The application allows users to input EMG signals for analysis.
2. **Signal Analysis:** Users can analyze the input EMG signals using various algorithms and techniques.
3. **View-Model Architecture:** The project follows a view-model architecture, separating concerns and providing a structured approach to development.
4. **Controller.py:** To launch the application, users can execute the `controller.py` script, which serves as the entry point for the application.

## Usage:
To use the Myonset M1 application, follow these steps:
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the `controller.py` script using Python: `python controller.py`.
4. The GUI application will launch, allowing users to interact with the EMG signal detection and analysis functionalities.

## File Format Support:
The application supports .bdf file extensions for EMG signal input.
